README Report: Python Requests, APIs, and JSON
Overview

This README provides an overview of the WeatherPy and VacationPy projects, detailing the objectives, tools, and methodologies employed in each deliverable.(more detail instructions are allocated on README.PDF)

Part 1: WeatherPy
WeatherPy focuses on creating a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities located at varying distances from the equator. This project utilizes the citipy Python library for city selection and the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data retrieval. The primary goal is to construct a representative model of weather patterns across cities.

Part 2: VacationPy
VacationPy extends the analysis conducted in WeatherPy to plan future vacations based on weather preferences. This phase integrates Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. The project leverages the weather data obtained in Part 1 and employs Python skills to create map visualizations for vacation planning.

Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used for both WeatherPy and VacationPy.
Jupyter Notebooks: Utilized in VacationPy for interactive data analysis and visualization.
citipy Python Library: Employed in WeatherPy for city selection based on coordinates.
OpenWeatherMap API: Used in WeatherPy to retrieve weather data for selected cities.
Geoapify API: Utilized in VacationPy for additional geographic data and map visualization.
geoViews Python Library: Integrated into VacationPy for creating map visualizations.
Methodologies
Both WeatherPy and VacationPy follow a similar methodology of data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.

Data Retrieval: City data is obtained using the citipy library by generating random coordinates and finding the nearest city.
API Requests: Weather data is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API using the city information obtained in step 1.
Data Processing: The retrieved data is processed and analyzed to extract relevant weather information.
Visualization: Visualization techniques are applied to represent weather patterns and plan vacation destinations effectively.
Getting Started
To replicate the analysis conducted in WeatherPy and VacationPy, follow these steps:

Install Python and required libraries such as citipy, geoViews, and Jupyter Notebooks.
Obtain API keys for the OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify API.
Clone the repository containing the project files.
Run the provided Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to execute the analysis and visualization.
Conclusion
WeatherPy and VacationPy offer valuable insights into weather patterns across cities and facilitate efficient vacation planning based on weather preferences. By leveraging Python programming, APIs, and visualization libraries, these projects demonstrate the power of data-driven decision-making in various domains.
